They've all been involved in overcharging students for cleaning fees when leases end for years and years. They rely on students being naive and moving out-of-town, accepting reduced deposits or forfeiting entire deposit amounts. Unfortunately, the owners of these companies donate heavily to local politicians, and the local city councils in both Champaign and Urbana allow them to continue these practices. The University has a hands-off policy as well, since this is all done by LLC companies, not publicly accountable agencies. The OP's plan to organize a class action lawsuit is a great idea, but local attorneys MIGHT be difficult to find to help out, because again...they are allied with local real estate interests. Consulting with UIUC's student legal services might be the key to change, but I hope the Illinois Attorney General's office gets involved: they have the power to sanction and fine these companies, and take legal action if necessary.

      "So, this is a serious situation. You need to have someone come to your apartment and find the bat and how it got in.

They don’t make that call, and the threshold for making it is pretty high.

The tow company has to pay a professional to move the car without damaging it; they have to be legally responsible for it to ensure it isn’t damaged or stolen while in their possession; and they have to have the staff to make it available to the right person upon request.

      "Error processing text: A lot of the frustration with the counseling center comes from misplaced expectations on what it actually offers, which is mostly the University’s fault for not promoting it properly.  The counseling center’s purpose is to help students, but they can only accommodate a small amount of long term clients due to the size of the student body and the limited amount of counselors they have. They will do a certain number of sessions with you and then try to refer you out to somewhere else in the community. If you are looking to just try therapy short-term for a few sessions, or want help finding other mental health resources in town, it could definitely be useful. But if you are looking for something long term I would research other options. People expect a team of about 20 counselors to be a catch-all solution to the entire breadth of potential mental health issues of 50,000 students, but really they are a crisis management/referral service. If you are keeping all that in mind I think it’s worth trying out. I doubt the counseling center will somehow make your social skills worse, and if you’re just looking to vent I’m sure they’d be fine for that.\n",

If you go to the actual library and find a map with all the locations of the Library of Congress numbers, you can usually find the vast array of shelves that have books you'd want to read.

Women’s orgs (and orgs associated with industry minorities generally speaking, though I can only personally speak for women’s orgs) inherently have a harder job to do with less resources than the average engineering RSO, and I don’t necessarily think it’s fair to expect the same level of depth from them. Let me explain what I mean.\n",

      "Let’s say the average freshman CS major can join one professional RSO before going crazy. To simplify, we’re gonna say that freshman CS majors can pick between ACM and WCS. ACM is targeted at all genders but in practice is male dominated, and WCS is mostly targeted at women and gender minorities. Let’s say that there are 600 men and 300 women in the incoming freshman CS class. Nearly 100% of freshman men in CS will pick ACM because they don’t necessarily need to seek out their gender to find it in this industry. Let’s say 2/3 of freshman women in CS join WCS and 1/3 join ACM. There are now 700 freshman in ACM and 200 freshman in WCS. As someone who has seen the internals of how clubs get funding, I can tell you both from a sponsorship standpoint and how SODA allocates funds that more attendance means more leverage for financial support. WCS’s job is to do what ACM does with much less people and less funding and *also* to build a strong support system for women in the field while trying to retain a much higher percentage of people to stay afloat (which explains why you tend to see a lot more socials, office hours, etc). In my opinion, this is basically an impossible task. I don’t really have a good, streamlined solution to problems like this, I’ve spent a notable amount of my undergraduate career trying to find just that. That being said, in the meantime I’ve learned to get what I can reasonably expect to get out of women’s engineering RSOs, and looking back I wish I’d gotten more involved with them sooner. \n",

I would recommend trying to do at least one social thing a week (or every two weeks, do what is most manageable to you) that is slightly outside of your comfort zone, such as greeting a classmate/hallmate/random person, or attending a campus event. This is essentially exposure therapy and it'll slowly make it less intimidating to socialize with strangers. Making friends is just about impossible if you never initiate interactions (though some of my favorite friends were more extroverted people who did approach me first). This way, you can put yourself out there more and increase your chances of meeting someone you're socially compatible with. It doesn't guarantee friends, and I know it's exhausting to socialize with random people and not \"get\" anything meaningful out of it like a friend, but it's what'll make it easier to make friends. Also, here's a tip, [a study](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/09/deep-conversations-strangers) published through the American Psychological Association found that, \"People overestimate awkwardness, underestimate enjoyment of deep, meaningful conversations\" (just bring up deep conversation topics with people, the majority of the time both you and the other person will enjoy it way more than you expected).\n",

They'd be taking revenue away from student legal services, from Law, from LSA, each of whom aren't gaining anything from the hire.

Obviously im not as smart as you (GVSU vs. UofM is a night and day difference). but don’t give up, I left GRCC with a 3.9 gpa, was given a small scholarship to attend Davenport university. From there my advisor pushed me to pursue an MBA (which i have one semester left and have increased my scholarship amount due to strong grades). Michigan may be your dream school, but it may not be the school for YOU. however, I wouldn’t make any changes if you only have one year left here. I doubt this message helps, but i think it helped me open about my past\n",

I’m pretty sure that regardless of if you file your taxes from your jobs as independent or dependent, financial aid will process the aid from your parents income. The only exceptions to this is if you are legally emancipated, orphan, married I think, and a few other things. Getting a job will not impact the aid you get based on your parents income lol. You need to read up on this in the student aid website and look into it for yourself. There’s a reason why so many people have issues with financial aid especially for the students that have been very independent and supporting themselves through their low incomes but aren’t able to escape their parents income which is what their aid is evaluated by. So many kids are stuck in situations where their parents income holds them back from getting grants but the parents won’t support them even though they are the single defining factor for if they can afford school or not. And if this is the case for you, which it most likely is, I would look into getting better jobs off campus because the student employment typically doesn’t pay much.\n",

If you open the floodgates to less qualified students, you either have to accept that there will be a lot of failing students or that the courses will need to be made less demanding. The former is terrible from the perspective of enabling your students to succeed, the latter is terrible because you now have less rigor and depth.\n",

It also provides cheaper tuition and scholarships to in-state students.\n",

This is necessarily  still a useful, likely is the best definition because it is the definition used by Netanyahu, Ben Gvir, and the Likud party.  As recently as this week they have shown maps showing their plans to seize the entire west bank for permanent Israeli settlement in full, and their language towards gaza has been of how to evict them so that israeli settlers can begin moving in.  That is practical, actual, in effect, real zionism in action.  That is what protesters are specifically talking about.  If we are attempting to be most understanding, a sticker like in the OP would be referring to the zionist soldiers who maybe killed a family member of theirs during one of the many mass evictions, much in the way a colonial american might have said \"Death to Redcoats!\".  Of course, too many people also use the phrase to mean \"average person who supports zionism but isnt actually firing the guns or passing the laws\" which is a problem, our whole goal in this discussion is to think how best we can get to a scenario where apartheid is over and civilians can live in peace regardless of their prior beliefs.  But you also have to be wary of tone policing revolutionary fervor when there is actual blood spilled, especially when we are american and really shouldnt be choosing a winner in the fight of who gets to evict who, we should be working towards a solution that evicts nobody.\n",

Speak to people in the language they use.  If you want protesters to stop using the word zionist to describe people like Netanyahu, then you should be able to provide an alternate clear, efficient, and accurate term for them to use instead, otherwise they will use the same term in the same way its been used since 1899 when the zionists themselves called the region palestine\n",

Popov goes through slides very quickly and you basically have to learn most of it yourself outside of class.

One thing you can do is to do well in courses and work on technical skills needed for your research area of interest (in your case statistical programming in R or Python) and take core classes that are helpful to research areas you are interested in.

Trump does seem to be more blindly pro-Israel than Harris - but, even if you do genuinely believe they are both equal on the issue, I find it likely that, if you're pro-Palestine, you're also in support of other issues (such as abortion rights, and/or LGBTQIA+ rights, and/or freedom of speech and/or religion) that you're more likely to vote for Harris than Trump on. It also sounds like you voted in the Democratic primary, so I'm guessing you tend to vote more Democratic than Republican. If I'm right about any of this, meaning that you probably would have voted for Harris if not for her Israel-Palestine stance (which you think Trump is equally bad for), voting for nobody is essentially taking away a vote from Harris. It's not like neither of them will win as a result of your voting uncommitted - it's that Trump is ever so slightly more likely to win. And if you genuinely have no preference between the two of them, well, I disagree with you, but you'll at least be voting your conscience. But, if that's not the case, and you do have some slight preference for one candidate over the other, then your not voting is really just taking away a vote for the candidate that you'd like to win. Even if they do notice that a lot of people have voted uncommitted over Palestine, what then? Either Harris wins, in which case, if you're right that all she cares about is the votes, it doesn't matter whether or not you voted uncommitted - or, Trump wins, in which case Trump is president and also Harris has less direct power to take action over that issue, especially after January. Maybe, in four years, if she or someone else runs again, and if they're convinced by this election, and if the situation persists, they could take action on it then - but wouldn't things be even more irrevocable at that point?\n",

I also voted uncommitted because there was no candidate who stood a chance of winning that primary that I would be substantially more unhappy with than any other candidate. I will not vote uncommitted in the general election (which I also believe was the larger uncommitted voter movement's official stance at the time - I seem to remember them encouraging people to vote for Biden in the general election still over Trump, though I could well be misremembering). I will not vote uncommitted because I have the power to make it ever so slightly more likely that Harris becomes president instead of Trump, and I really, *really* do not want Trump to be president.\n",

I fully get the sentiment that politicians should be the ones who have to win over our votes, because that definitely *should* be the case. However, the fact is that my vote still holds some small amount of power; and, even if I wish Harris would have to work harder to earn my vote, the fact that she currently doesn't doesn't absolve me of any responsibility from how I'm voting, and whatever (admittedly small) amount of impact it can and will have.

      "What about how many students get \\*accepted\\* to the University?  That's a different story.  The University admits many more nonresidents than residents,  Why?  Because on average far fewer of them will accept the offer and enroll as students.  U-M is a much more expensive institution to attend if you don't live in Michigan, so it's not going to stack up as well against students' other college options (some of which may be way cheaper if they are in the student's home state).  Whereas if you live in Michigan and get admitted, suddenly you have a choice that is highly regarded AND is reasonable (even affordable if you get aid).  Knowing more residents will say yes after being admitted, the University sends out fewer acceptance letters to Michiganders.  So to be clear: more nonresidents may get the acceptance letter, but that doesn't mean that UM is, in the end, going to enroll more nonresidents.\n",

Because that goes over my full need or total cost(I'm not sure which hence why you should contact the financial aid office), the financial aid office will remove some of the aid they gave to Match.

      "\n",
      "**Workload**\n",
      "\n",
      "1) **Required workload of RAs is very much dependent on your hall director.** There was a trend during my undergrad days that housing upper management started requiring RAs to meet and log interactions with students but in the end your hall director decides on how much emphasis to give for that job. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) **How much work you do is dependent on yourself.** For the events you have to hold every month you can do simple things like board game night and tea hour in the lounges near your community with 0 effort or you can book a room to organize movie nights and get funding for popcorn etc. where you have to do more hands on work. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) **RA work on paper and actuality differs.** On paper you work 20 hours a week but in reality due to points 1 and 2 above your actual week to week work is much lower.

On a hourly basis, taking 20 as the baseline, this used to be roughly $22/hour. Back when average wages for on campus jobs like dining were $10/hour this was pretty good. Yet, nowadays with the increases to minimum wages across the campus ($15/hour, usually more), the pay differential is not as good. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The the hourly compensation is based on a single room and 20h/week work assumption but in reality, you should compare to other housing options you have (in this case, compare to what you can make outside of being an RA and compare it to your current lease and what you pay for food on average.)\n",

In your case it will be either of 250 or 280 since stats is most likely a requirement for Pysch. Some majors have their version of introduction to statistics but courses like STATS 250 satisfy the requirement for all majors whereas majors specific ones usually do so only for that major as such you cannot go wrong with it.\n",

I think the Physics Student Lounge on 3rd floor has such coffee for students but I am unsure about the rules around its usage.

Their students and scholars thus bump up against painful roadblocks.
